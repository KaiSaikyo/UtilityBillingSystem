# Utility Billing System

### Project Scenario

PS Group is a utility company in Singapore that provides cooking gas, electricity, and water. To improve efficiency, the company has decided to introduce a utility billing program for its customers. The program will allow customers to submit their utility meter readings and receive actual bills based on their consumption. The utility billing program must also adhere to the MVC design model.

### Functions and Requirements

A user interface (UI) for customers to submit meter readings and view calculated bills, as well as UI for staff to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) price charges. The program should implement customer components using user management to grant restricted access for staff to view customer bills.
